------------------------ PROGRESS REPORT ------------------------
Week: 13th Jan 2025
Aim to upload deliverables by 15th Jan 2025

Results:

1. Explored the structure of MWNS dataset
    Platform: RStudio IDE
2. Using R, iteratively created png images for each parameter for each river.
    Image: MWNS-CHEMMA/dataExploration/image
    Script: dataExploration/Rscript/MWNSdataExploration.R
    Total number of images: 598
3. Located Monitoring Station through coordinates. See MWNS-CHEMMA/dataExploration/image/GIS/MWNS_mntStation.PNG
    Platform: QGIS

Findings:

1. Inital RStudio IDE setup took some time.
2. It seems there was probably a major, serious pollution event for Big Creek in the late 2019, where several parameters show abrupt concentration increases ï¼ˆi.e. silver, cadnium, nickle, etc)
3. Not all parameters are monitored throughout the duration of the program. Some watershed has very few datapoints (e.g. temperature for Larches Creek)

Next:

1. Finish data exploration (MWNSdataExploration.R)
2. Find out the if seasonal trends exist, if so how
3. Find out what's going on with the concentration spike for Big Creek (late 2019 event)
4. Explore statistics for each river
5. Explore if correlations exist for any pair of rivers
6. Probe concentration trends for parameters that are likely
