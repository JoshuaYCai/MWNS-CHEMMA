        "MWNS KNOW YOUR DATA"

Results:

1. Explored the structure of MWNS dataset
    Platform: RStudio IDE
2. Using R, iteratively created png images for each parameter for each river.
    Image: MWNS-CHEMMA/dataExploration/image
    Script: dataExploration/Rscript/MWNSdataExploration.R
    Total number of images: 598
3. Located Monitoring Station through coordinates. See MWNS-CHEMMA/dataExploration/image/GIS/MWNS_mntStation.PNG
    Platform: QGIS

Findings:

1. Inital RStudio IDE setup took some time.
2. It seems there was probably a major, serious pollution event for Big Creek in the late 2019, where several parameters show abrupt concentration increases ï¼ˆi.e. silver, cadnium, nickle, etc)
3. Not all parameters are monitored throughout the duration of the program. Some watershed has very few datapoints (e.g. temperature for Larches Creek)

Next:

1. Finish data exploration (MWNSdataExploration.R)
2. Find out the if seasonal trends exist, if so how
3. Find out what's going on with the concentration spike for Big Creek (late 2019 event)
4. Explore statistics for each river
5. Explore if correlations exist for any pair of rivers
6. Probe concentration trends for parameters that are likely

        "SEASONAL TREND"

Results:

1. Produced on jpeg image that shows variation of all parameters of all rivers throughtout the seasonal cycle. See seasonal_trends.png

Findings:

1. KKUT (potassium), NNOTUR (nitrate total), ZIUT (zinc), VVUT (vanadium), TIUT (titanium), CAUT (calcium), CLIDUR (chloride) have higher varaition in summer.
2. River waters were harder as HARDT (hardness) for some rivers
3. Generally, rivers are varying in turbidity during winter-spring phase, i.e. some rivers might be more turbid during winter-spring phase (higher variation in TRUB)
